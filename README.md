# IntFloatMultiply_C
C Int multiply float for calcuation accuracy check

Linux: 
```terminal
$ gcc main.c -o main
$ ./main
```

## Two number calculations..
To perform the combination of multiplications on just two numbers provide the two numbers as arguments:
```terminal
$ ./main 3055 6111
```
## Range calculations...
To perform the range calculation just put a Max Value as a single argument.
```terminal
$ ./main 7000
```
This will calculate the combinations of multiplications for both numbers ranging from 1 to Max Value

## Odd Ball Calculations...
To perform the Odd ball calculation execute without any parameters.
```terminal
$ ./main
```
The Odd Ball calculation is a predetermined set of numbers that cause an error.  These are set to compare to other platforms and languages such as C or Rust.
